# Spotify
## Objective
Using a Sample dataset of Spotify's user's and subscriber's to determine the top artists by factprs such as most download, most views, and many others.
## Data
The data used for this project found on Kaglle's website for public datasets and can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data)
## Resolution
First I examined the dataset with python to see if any data was duplicated or missing data. There was 79 dupilicates in deezer playlists, 57 in shazam charts, 95 in key category. Then i removed the duplicates and found no more and no data was missing. next i ran code to create a feature to help with analysis by have it count artists doing solo work as seperate counts. Then i created a heat map to see if there was a correlation between number of streams and the number of playlists and found the correlation was really strong. From my findings It can be determined that the top artists on spotify for 2023 do have a strong correlation between number of streams and number of playlists.
